            Virtual Reality was once an impossible thought amongst scholars. 
            However, now it has become more advanced and is constantly improving. 
            Not only has it become a recent phenomenom, it has started to be an essential 
            part of industries and education today.

            Virtual reality started out as simple simulation in the 1930's with the first flight
            simulations to help train young pilots. That then grew into more complex designs of 
            headsets that track eye movement; soon the body became involved, and now social interaction and an
            entire world can be created. (For more information on the history of Virtual Reality please visit

            in our society today.
