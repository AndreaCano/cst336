        <p class="overview">
            Virtual Reality(VR) has recently become a huge advancement in the medical field.
            As we already know, VR has the capability to create almost realistic surroundings
            and environments, but it also has the capability to recreate the human body. 
            This gives people in the medical field (including students) an inside look to 
            possible situations without wasting valuable resources.

        <p class="overview">
            Companies such as <a href = "https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertglatter/2015/05/22/how-virtual-reality-may-change-medical-education-and-save-lives/#b4a970f61bfc">Next Galaxy</a>
            , have invested in making VR a more accessible 
            tool for these purposes. Not only do they want it for medicinal reasons but also
            for education. Currently, they are working towards creating a CPR model to teach the 
            proper way to help a choking victim. The <a href = "#3dvideo"> video above</a> is an example of
            how 360 virtual reality can help to visually learn and teach.
