        <p class="overview">
            Gaming has become a part of almost every American citizen's life now. 
            Graphics are getting higher, games are getting more complex and now instead of holding
            a controller, you can just use your motions! In fact, it wasn't until the early 2010s
            that gaming would work with virtual reality with patents for new 
            VR gaming headsets and the announcement of the Oculus Rift, this made headsets that are
            now being sold commercially, 
            which include: HTC Vive often used for computer gaming, Samsung Gear VR,
            Google Cardboard for smart phone play and even
            the Sony Playstation VR, setting the standard for console virtual reality.

            <p class="overview">
            And that is why gaming industry is being taken over by virtual reality according to this <a href = "https://www.cnet.com/news/virtual-reality-is-taking-over-the-video-game-industry/">article</a>.
            Mostly implemented in shooters or horror games, virtual reality is creating environments to completely
            immerse players into a game.
