            You know what is going to help get children to go outside more? NOT this advancement with 
            virtual reality. 
            <br>
            But it is still really amazing to see implemented! This enhancement is meant to help communicate 
            with people at the safety of their own home as well as keep in touch with people. Facebook, the social 
            network experts, are funding this project to make it into a new reality. The video shows how far they have gotten 
            in their beta testing. (Interested? Here is an <a href = "https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602579/facebook-begins-its-push-to-make-us-socialize-in-virtual-reality/">article</a>
